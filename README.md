# Stupid-Learn

This repository is a simple compilation of naive implementations of common machine learning algorithms in c++.

Most of the impleentations are non regularized and are a mix of techniques from Andrew Ng's course on coursera 
and Tom M. Mitchell's book, "Machine Learning".

Please install [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) before trying out any of the examples.

## Examples
  - You can try out the implementations by running the examples in the Example folder
    1. To run an example firslty change directory into the examples folder
    2. Then run it using a c++ compiler (E.g. - g++ NeuralNetworkExample.cpp ../NeuralNetwork.cpp -larmadillo)
  - You can check out the datasets in Data/ folder in the Examples folder.
  - For data with low dimensionality you can always print output to a csv and plot to judge the results.
  
## Documentation
  - I have recently come across Doxygen as a documentation tool and have used it for the class documentation.
  - You can start reading the documentation here [Stupid-Learn-Documentation](https://abhay447.github.io/stupid-learn/html/index.html).
